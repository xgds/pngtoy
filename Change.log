Change log for pngtoy
---------------------

0.6.1 ALPHA
ADD: Extended Chunk object with method to obtain its own raw data incl/excl chunk container
IMP: Improved PNG type checking by including minimum file size required.

0.6.0 ALPHA
ADD: toMinimal() method to produce a stripped down version of the original PNG containing only needed chunks.
ADD: fetch() can now take an ArrayBuffer or Typed Array as well in addition to URL, Data-URI and Object-URL.
ADD: Partial node.js support (untested in this version! - use at own risk). Can only take an ArrayBuffer (not Buffer). For URLs a XMLHttpRequest shim for node.js is required.
RPL: Replace Pako zlib to ezlib (slightly stripped down version only supporting typed arrays).

0.5.6 ALPHA
IMP: Minor improvements

0.5.5 ALPHA
FIX: Unordered chunks between IDAT and IEND would throw off parser.

0.5.0 ALPHA
ADD: `getChunk(str)` method replacing individual methods (e.g. `get_IDAT()` -> `getChunk("IDAT")` etc.).
REM: All `get_*()` methods.

0.4.6 ALPHA
CHG: Updated pako.inflate to more recent version

0.4.5 ALPHA
ADD: New option `beforeSend` taking a function to execute before sending via XHR.

0.4.0 ALPHA
ADD: Extension chunks oFFs, sCAL, pCAL, sTER
ADD: Text field sanitation
FIX: sBIT wasn't wired up to API
FIX: Internal offset to unit field in pHYs chunk

0.3.0 ALPHA
ADD: Big image test (4k x 4k) [removed again due to using old logo, will regenerate later]
ADD: Boolean status for IEND chunk (get_IEND()).
ADD: Preliminary documentation (doesn't go too much into details yet)
CHG: guessGamma() -> guessDisplayGamma() to better distinguish what gamma type is being guessed
CHG: Adjusting block-size to a more optimal value for large async loaded images

0.2.0 ALPHA
ADD: PngImage object to simulate image object loading.
ADD: Gamma guessing method (for display, Windows, Mac OS)
FIX: Corrected formula for gamma calculation

0.1.3 ALPHA
ADD: tRNs chunk support for grey 1 and 4-bit (fixes tbbn0g04.png)
FIX: Buffer size for small sizes (fixes s01i3p01, s01n3p01, s02i3p01, s02n3p01, s04n3p01, s06n3p02).
FIX: Buffer size align for small sizes (fixes s03n3p01, s05n3p02, s07n3p02, s04n3p01, s06n3p02).
FIX: Fixed line padding for depth < 8 (fixes small and odd sizes for non-interlaced, interlaced <= 3x3 works)
FIX: Index 1 palette fixed bit-shifting and palette index order (in RGBA converter).
FIX: RGB8 is only passed through converter if no gamma is needed and aspect ratio is not in use or is 1:1
TDO: Check gamma calculation in more details

0.1.2 ALPHA
ADD: tRNs chunk support for grey and color 8/16-bit (fixes tbwn0g16.png, tbbn2c16.png, tbgn2c16.png, tbrn2c08.png)
